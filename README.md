It makes sense for duration and impressions to be directly related as the longer the duration, the higher the exposure, and the higher the familiarity and impressionableness. It's not the case in this scenario as it seems that longevity of the time that the ads run have no effect on the number of impressions. This is a highly poor measure of future impressions as the rsq value is not even 1% meaning barely 1% of the durations data can explain/predict future impressions. We would need a different variable to better explain and improve methods to increase impressions.
